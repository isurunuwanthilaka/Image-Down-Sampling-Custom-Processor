##  Image-Down-Sampling-Custom-Processor

This project is to down sample a 256\*256 image to 128\*128 image.

Here we have several process to decide before implementing the code.

1. Develop a suitable downsapling algorithm in matlab and simulate it.
2. Design ISA considering the algorithm we developed and its main funtionalities.
3. Design the state machine,required registers,data paths etc.
4. Implement the code with assembly according to the ISA we have developed.
5. Create a test bench simulate it for error free processor.
6. UART link to upload and retrieve image from FPGA.
7. Test with real time images and debugging for 0 SSD.
